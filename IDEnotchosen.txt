After reading many articles regarding which is the best IDE to use. I chose not to use Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE for this course
because my previous programming class in Java 1 required me to use IntelliJ IDEA as my primary IDE.
For this, I feel more comfortable not using Visual Studio Code as my main IDE since I have more experience
using IntelliJ IDEA. In addition to this, I choose not to use Visual Studio Code
because it offers additional features and tools that I have yet been to be exposed to, which may negatively affect my understanding
of how to create and execute Java scripts. Apart from this, my final reason for not using Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE is because
I don't currently have Visual Studio Code installed and configured on my computer. However, I do have IntelliJ IDEA
installed and configured to my preference on my desktop, which helped me save time from configuring a new IDE on to my computer.
Overall, these are the reasons I avoided using Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE for this course.

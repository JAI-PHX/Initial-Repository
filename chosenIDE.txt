My chosen IDE for this course is IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. The reason I chose to use IntelliJ IDEA
as my primary IDE for this class is due to my previous Java 1 course requiring me to use IntelliJ IDEA as my primary IDE.
This early exposure to IntelliJ IDEA gave me more experience programming in Java, which will help me learn about
the material in this course more effectively since I don't need to relearn a new IDE. In addition, I have
already configured and installed IntelliJ IDEA on my desktop, which helped me save time in terms of installing a new IDE and configuring it to my preference.
Apart from this, the main reason why I chose to use IntelliJ IDEA as my primary IDE for this class is because it integrates seamlessly with Git and GitHub.
IntelliJ IDEA offers a dedicated version control system that allows me to access Git and any created repository on GitHub.
This direct connection to Git and GitHub makes it easy for me to commit changes, create branches, and merge code, all without
needing to leave the IntelliJ IDEA interface. Overall, IntelliJ IDEA with its all-in-one integration
with GitHub and Git pushed me to use IntelliJ IDEA as my primary IDE for this class.

Using GitHub can help me in my future career since I can create a portfolio that publishes my projects and demonstrates my programming skills
and professional accomplishments to the public. I can use GitHub's free platform to create repositories to publish, host, and manage
my projects and demonstrate my effectiveness in various programming languages, including Java and Python. As well as that
by creating and organizing my project into a repository on GitHub, I can publicly demonstrate my coding quality, deep understanding of frameworks, and coding expertise. Overall, publishing my projects on GitHub can illustrate my skill and effectiveness as a programmer to potential employers, which can
sway their decision to hire me.
In addition to this, I can use GitHub pages to create a professional portfolio directly on the GitHub website. I can create and customize
my GitHub portfolio to showcase my programming skills, certifications, education, resume, and contact information, which can help me
catch the attention of potential employers. Likewise, my GitHub page can direct potential employers to my public repository, ensuring that they know
my skill set and understand the potential benefits I can bring to their company. Overall, this professional portfolio on the GitHub page allows potential employers to explore my work and learn about my background.
